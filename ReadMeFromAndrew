A handful of my Unit tests are failing. I believe it's all related to the CompensationRepository I added not being properly added to the ServicesCollection.

Also, the DirectReports property of the employee is NULL when calling GetById in the EmployeeService. I expected that to contain the list, so my attempt to get the full number of reports failed, but I'd like to discuss all of this during the review.

"No database provider has been configured for this DbContext. A provider can be configured by overriding the DbContext.OnConfiguring method or by using AddDbContext on the application service provider. If AddDbContext is used, then also ensure that your DbContext type accepts a DbContextOptions<TContext> object in its constructor and passes it to the base constructor for DbContext."
